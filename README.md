# Redux Observable App

Sandbox Application to jump into redux-observable, rxjs in redux arrive quite late, it has a small comunity and it has a lot of issues, hard migrations, versioning deprecation... and so on. Anyway I decide to do this didactical course to study the alternative to the popular but verbose Redux-Saga wondered by the simplicity offered here. Allways have to try before judge.
